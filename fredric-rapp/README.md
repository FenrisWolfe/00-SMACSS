##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

Anything that dealt with how the page was laid out went into the layout CSS, conversely the base CSS I filled with global settings and the modules for specific rules.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not refactor anything. Although I did notice there is a closing </div> with no opening <div> and there is a missing image file referenced in the style.css regardless I moved that reference to its required .CSS file.
