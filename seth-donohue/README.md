##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

This was not clear for me, so i just moved the single selected elements into the base, the id selected into the layout, and the class selected into modules.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No refactoring done.
