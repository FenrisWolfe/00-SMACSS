##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

(based on what each did, if it was the color or font style it would be the base. If it determined the size of a container then it went in layout. The specifics of classes all went into modules.)

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

(yes by splitting apart the colors and text transformations from margin width and borders etc.)
