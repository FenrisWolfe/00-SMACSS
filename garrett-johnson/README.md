##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I felt like anything that is overarching layout of the page and not specific elements deserves to be in the layout page. The base header/footer/body tags go into the base. In module I put anything that's more specific than those rules.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I don't believe I did I was mainly struggling with what goes where.
