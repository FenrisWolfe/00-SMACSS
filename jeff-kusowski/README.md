##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I tried to figure out what styles applied across the entire site and moved them to base.  I moved styles that applied to organization of the site to layout.  And I moved styles that applied to very specific pieces and not likely to be reused to modules.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No.
