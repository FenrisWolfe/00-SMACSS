##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I decided to take normal html style tags from the CSS and put them into the base file since they closely run the same way in the HTML file.

I added the all the #tags into the layout file since they were being targeted by ID and I decided that it would be appropriate to have it in the layout file.

The rest was added to the modules file since they were CSS commands targeting specific locations in tags.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not do any refactoring at all.
