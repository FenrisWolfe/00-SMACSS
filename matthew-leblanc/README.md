##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

For the base.css, I figured that should hold the general rules for the main tags: body, nav, aside, etc.

Then for the layout.css, more of general styling for any element inside of the main tags: paragraph in the aside, lists in the nav, etc.

And lastly for the module.css, is all the fine-tuning: setting most of the components to their proper corresponding location and style.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I added 'text-decoration: none;' to the anchor tag, because for any link, I personally don't like the underscore decoration.
